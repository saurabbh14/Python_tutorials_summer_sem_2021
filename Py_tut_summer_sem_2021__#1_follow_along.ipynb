        "We live in the digital age. Many everyday things run on computers and devices that are machines built to do calculations on bits (a discrete value of either 0 or 1, using [Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) as its basis). from a calculator to the fastest supercomputers on earth, the principle the exact same thing.\n",

        "Modern computers and the processing units on it (the parts that actually do the calculations, e. g. a central processing unit (CPU) in a personal computer) operates with a small set of instructions on how to work with bits and bytes (arrays of bits). So, the computer needs instructions in form of these commands. This so-called machine code is typically not human-readable. This is where programming languages come into play. \n",

        "\n",
        "Generally, there are two types of programming languages:\n",
        "- Compiled languages (such as Fortran, C, C++, Haskell): Here, a compiler program is required to translate the code to machine-readable information. The compiler generates a file that then can be executed. After each change in the code the compiler has to be re-run and the executable updated.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Interpreted languages (such as Python, Matlab, JavaScript): Here, instead of having a compiler generating an executable, an interpreter is used which dynamically (in the moment of reading the code) generates the machine-code instructions. Upon changing the code, the interpreter is restarted and the new program is run directly. \n",

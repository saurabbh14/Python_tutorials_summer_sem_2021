# Python_tutorials_summer_sem_2021
Welcome to python tutorials.
Let's get started on how to access the tutorial sheets.
1) first thing we need is a google account(one can also access these notebooks in Jupyter project's platform)
2) if that's done, open the notebook link and on the top of the file there should be an option of "open with colab"
3) press that button and you should be redirected to googlecolab using your google account. Make sure that you are logged in to the Google.

If you encounter any problem, do not hesitate to mail me (saurabh.mhatre@uni-jena.de)
